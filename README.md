# BullyWatch: A Machine Learning Approach to Cyberbullying Detection
# Description
# Problem Statement
Cyberbullying is when someone uses the internet or technology to be mean, hurtful, or cruel to another person. It can happen through messages, posts, comments, or sharing things that are meant to make someone feel bad, embarrassed, or scared. This kind of bullying can happen on social media, in online games, or even through texts. Cyberbullies might tease, spread rumors, send threatening messages, or share private information to harm someone, and it can make the person being bullied feel really upset, sad, or scared about going online or using their phone. This also causes severe emotional harm, Anxiety, Depression, and low self-esteem thatâ€™s why it is vital to develop tools and methods that can identify and prevent it.
# Objective
- The objective of this project is to create a system that can identify and stop cyberbullying.
- The aim is to swiftly detect and mitigate harmful content or actions, thereby fostering safer and more respectful online environments.
- Ultimately, the goal is to protect individuals from the negative impacts of cyberbullying by enabling proactive interventions and support mechanisms.
- This system will help protect people from online bullying and make the internet a safer place for everyone.
- We will also be able to predict the reason of cyber bullying eg: age, gender, religion, etc.
- Reducing the reliance on manual moderation and content review by automating the detection process, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive for online platforms.
- The system also able to predict accurately whether a given text involves cyberbullying or not and even the reason for the same.
# Dataset
Dataset taken is Twitter dataset from Kaggle. It contain more than 47,000 tweets and lables which are classified into 6 classes of cyberbullying. These are as:
- Age
- Gender
- Religion
- Ethnicity
- Other types of cyberbullying
- Not cyberbullying
  
The dataset is already balanced  containing 8,000 samples of each class.
# Comparison based on performance of all applied models
